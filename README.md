# Telecom-Churn
One of the biggest challenges that large companies face is customer churn, which has a direct impact on their revenue, particularly in the telecommunications industry.By analyzing customer behavior and preferences, companies can gain insights into the factors that contribute to churn.

Telecommunications involves the transmission of information electronically across long distances, including voice, data, text, images, and video. Telecommunications networks connect computer systems over remote locations, allowing for efficient communication.

In the present day, the telecommunications industry faces intense competition in satisfying its customers. Predicting customer churn has become crucial not only for accurately identifying potential churners, but also for understanding customer behavior.

To remain competitive, telecom companies must constantly improve their services, including customer support and pricing plans, and leverage the power of data analytics to gain a competitive edge in the market. By utilizing targeted data analytics, telecom companies can better understand their customers' behavior and preferences, helping them to maintain or enhance their position in the highly competitive marketplace.
